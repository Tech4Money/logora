## 🔹 How to Add “AI Creative & Media” into Logora

### Replit Prompt (paste into Generate-from-Prompt)

2. In `templates/index.html`

   * Add a new section titled **“🎨 AI Creative & Media”** under the startup prompt library.
   * Display all prompts as clickable cards (like your E-Commerce group).
   * On click, each card should insert its text into the textarea (`user_request`).

3. Styling

   * Use the same **glassmorphism + hover glow** design as E-Commerce prompts.
   * Responsive: 2–3 columns desktop, 1 column mobile.

### Deliverable

A new **AI Creative & Media** prompt library section in Logora, with 70 curated project prompts rendered as interactive cards.

```

---

✅ Once you paste this into Replit’s “prompt-to-build,” it’ll add the Creative & Media group to your UI.  

---

⚡ Next step: I can prep the **AI Dev Tools & Starters** catalog (Copilot-like assistants, API starters, SDKs, sandboxes, workflow engines).  

👉 Do you want me to draft that next in the same format so you can just drop it into the Replit prompt flow?
