Update my Flask app **Logora** to include a library of 30 public "Startup Idea Starter Prompts".  

### Requirements
1. In `app.py`  
   - Add a Python list named `startup_prompts` with 30 entries (provided below).  
   - Make sure they can be accessed by the UI.

2. In `templates/index.html`  
   - Add a new section **Startup Idea Starters** above the text input form.  
   - Render the `startup_prompts` list as clickable cards.  
   - When clicked, they should fill the textarea (`user_request`) with that prompt.  

3. Styling:  
   - Each card should have a modern glassmorphism style (rounded corners, hover glow, gradient border).  
   - Responsive grid (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile).  
   - Match existing dark mode / light mode variables.
